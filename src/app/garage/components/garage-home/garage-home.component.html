  <h1>Garage Tips</h1>
  <p>
    Transform your garage into a functional space by organizing tools and
    equipment on shelving units or wall-mounted racks. Consider installing
    durable flooring to protect against oil stains and enhance the overall
    appearance.

    Maximize storage efficiency by utilizing overhead space for hanging bicycles
    or installing ceiling-mounted storage racks. Create designated zones for
    different purposes, such as a workshop area for DIY projects and a storage
    area for seasonal items.
